When swaps are executed, the trader pays 0.3% swap fee and from this 0.05% is collected by the Polkapool Treasury account. Polkapool will use these tokens to buyback Polkadex tokens from the market by swapping in the corresponding pools. A portion of the converted Polkadex tokens is burned to keep the total supply at 20 million tokens and the remaining tokens will be sent to Polkadex Treasury.

**Polkadex Buyback mechanism is attractive to Polkadex users because of everyone who stakes Polkadex token in their wallet for feeless transactions** just got worth more. In this way, Polkadex maintains the supply constant and at the same time perpetually incentive liquidity mining.
