Polkadex ERC-20 pallet allows developers and project teams to issue tokens by sending a transaction in Polkadex. It is enables project teams in Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystem to issue tokens before their projects are developed completely.

## Key Features and Functionalities
* Tokens should have full ERC-20 functionality.

* Tokens should have an identity that can be approved by the governance to show support of the network ( That is, Like Twitter shows approved profiles, the governance can approve and attest tokens )

* Tokens have customizable vesting support from the date of registration, teams can define custom vesting period for each addresses. 

* These tokens can move freely to other parachains and to their native parachain.

* These tokens can move to Ethereum using Generic Handler Functionality of ChainBridge to call a smart contract in Ethereum that can deploy a ERC-20 contract that can mint/burn when tokens are sent from Polkadex to Ethereum or back. It gives backwards compatibility.
