Polkadex Fungible Assets allows developers and project teams to issue tokens by sending a transaction in Polkadex. It enables project teams in Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystem to issue tokens before their projects are developed completely.

## Key Features and Functionalities

- Tokens will have full ERC-20 functionality
- Tokens will have an identity that can be approved by the governance to show support of the network ( That is, Like Twitter shows approved profiles, the governance can approve and attest tokens ). It can avoid fake tokens and the community can attest project teams.
- Tokens can have customizable vesting support from the date of registration, teams can define custom vesting period for each addresses.
- These tokens can move freely to other parachains and to their native parachain.
- These tokens can move to Ethereum using  ChainBridge to call a smart contract in Ethereum that can deploy a ERC-20 contract that can mint/burn when tokens are sent from Polkadex to Ethereum or back. It gives backwards compatibility.
- Polkadex Fungible Assets pallet will be further extended to support tokenizing shares of a company, and other real world assets.
